# LolSoap #

A library for dealing with SOAP requests and responses. We tear our hair
out so you don't have to.

* Code: https://github.com/loco2/lolsoap
* Gem: http://rubygems.org/gems/lolsoap
* Docs: http://rubydoc.info/gems/lolsoap/frames

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/loco2/lolsoap.png)](http://travis-ci.org/loco2/lolsoap)

## Aims ##

* A collection of classes to make dealing with SOAP requests and
  responses, and WSDL documents, easier.
* The classes are intended to be loosely coupled and non-prescriptive
  about how they are used.
* LolSoap does not know anything about what HTTP library you want to
  use, and does not care whether you're doing the IO in a synchronous or
  asynchronous fashion. This does mean you have to provide a little bit
  of glue code, but the benefit is flexibility.
* No monkey-patching.
* Runs without warnings.

## Synopsis ##

``` ruby
# You will need your own HTTP client
http = MyHttpClient.new

# LolSoap::Client is just a thin wrapper object that handles creating
# other objects for you, with a given WSDL file
client = LolSoap::Client.new(File.read('lolapi.wsdl'))

# Create a request object
request = client.request('getLols')

# Populate the request with some data. Namespacing is taken care of
# using the type data from the WSDL. The WSDL also tells us whether
# a given name (e.g. lolFactor below) should be treated as an
# attribute or a sub-element.
request.body do |b|
  b.lolFactor '11'
  b.lolDuration 'lolever'
  ...
end

# See the full request XML
puts request.content

# Send that request!
raw_response = http.post(request.url, request.headers, request.content)

# Create a response object
response = client.response(request, raw_response)

# Get access to the XML structure (a Nokogiri::XML::Document)
p response.doc

# Get access to the first node inside the Body
p response.body

# Turn the body into a hash. The WSDL schema is used to work out which
# elements are supposed to be collections and which are just singular.
p response.body_hash
```

## Bugs/Features ##

* Assumes that you are able to supply a WSDL document for the service.
* Some of the finer details of namespace handling may be glossed over.
  This is just pragmatism; patches to improve namespace handling are
  welcome.

## Overview ##

These are some of the key classes. If you want, you can require them
directly (e.g. `require 'lolsoap/request'` rather than having to
`require 'lolsoap'`).

The main ones:

* `LolSoap::Request` - A HTTP request to be sent
* `LolSoap::Envelope` - The SOAP envelope in the body of a request
* `LolSoap::Response` - The API's response
* `LolSoap::WSDL` - A WSDL document

The others:

* `LolSoap::WSDLParser` - Lower level representation of the WSDL
  document
* `LolSoap::Builder` - XML builder object that knows about types, and
  therefore how elements should be namespaced.
* `LolSoap::Fault` - A SOAP 'fault' (error)
* `LolSoap::HashBuilder` - Builds hashes from the API response, using
  the WSDL type data to determine which elements are collection
  elements.

## WSSE ##

To append a WSSE node to the header using the `akami` gem:

```ruby
wsse = Akami.wsse
wsse.credentials(username, password)
request.header.__node__ << wsse.to_xml
```

## Changelog ##

### 0.4 ###

* Don't raise an exception on when a SOAP fault is detected. Whether or
  not this is an exceptional situation should be up to the user, as APIs
  may use SOAP faults to implement business logic errors.
* Ruby 1.8 support dropped

### 0.3 ###

* Support for WSDL inline type definitions and type extensions

### 0.2 ###

* SOAP 1.1 support
* Better handling of namespaces in the XML schema. You should now be
  able to have two types a:foo and b:foo and it will Just Work. This
  introduces some API incompatibilities with version 1.1. Specifically,
  `LolSoap::WSDL#types` is now keyed based on a prefixed type name
  rather than an unprefixed type name. This shouldn't affect you if
  you're not using `LolSoap::WSDL#types` directly.
* Add support for building attributes with `LolSoap::Builder` based on
  the XML Schema information.

### 0.1 ###
